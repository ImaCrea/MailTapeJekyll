description: "This morning, welcome on Dream Airlines. Our captain, Valentin Stip, will take us off to glowing masses of condensed sound vapor floating in the sky. Classical music and vibrant sunrays blend together over the sea of clouds, close your eyes and let the wave bring you till the edge of the atmosphere. We’ll get back on earth progressively to finally land in the middle of the Amazon rainforest where a tribe of brazilian shamans tripping on glue are waiting for us."

intro: This morning, welcome on Dream Airlines. Our captain, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Valentin-Stip/121985284555099" target="_blank">Valentin Stip</a>, will take us off to glowing masses of condensed sound vapor floating in the sky. Classical music and vibrant sunrays blend together over the sea of clouds, close your eyes and let the wave bring you till the edge of the atmosphere.<br/><br/>We’ll get back on earth progressively to finally land in the middle of the Amazon rainforest where a tribe of brazilian shamans tripping on glue are waiting for us.

guest_story_headline: A pianist's mind wandering through the infinite of computer music.
guest_story_content: Known for being part of Other People, Nicolas Jaar's label, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Valentin-Stip/121985284555099" target="_blank">Valentin Stip</a> is creating one of the most interesting listening experience we've heard in a long time. His subtle knowledge of perfect arrangement goes to a level we know in very few artists. His music breaks many barriers and manage to build a unique vibe pulling him out of Nico's shadow. We bet this is only the beginning of a great story, be sure to check his fresh debut album <a href="http://boomkat.com/downloads/908587-valentin-stip-sigh" target="_blank">"Sigh"</a>.

guest_explanation_headline: His morning inspiration
guest_explanation_track1: The way the melody comes out of sonic space is something that always brings my mind back from sleep smoothly.
guest_explanation_track2: This piece has been close to my heart since I was about 16. The clarity of vision and amount of emotion that I can feel in this piece is indescribable.
guest_explanation_track3: This last one (along with all the tracks on the same EP) is an ultimate feel good for me ! I might even snap my fingers and wiggle a little bit :)
