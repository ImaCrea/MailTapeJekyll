description: "This morning, please welcome, smoothly, The Jazzment. <br/>Sometimes you don't realize but it has been few years that you come back very often listening to the same artist, all naturally. That's the case for me and The Jazzment. Their relaxing flow put me at peace, hope they'll carry you on the same vibes this morning."

intro: This morning, please welcome, smoothly, <a href="http://thejazzment.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">The Jazzment</a>. <br/>Sometimes you don't realize but it has been few years that you come back very often listening to the same artist, all naturally. That's the case for me with The Jazzment. Their relaxing flow put me at peace, hope they'll carry you on the same vibes this morning.

guest_story_headline: The _Cool & Smooth_ Jazzment
guest_story_content: Three albums released on their<a href="http://thejazzment.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">bandcamp page</a> that can follow you everywhere. With calm, clarity, the dutch duo wrap you in a perfect and delightful mood. Sit snugly with a good cup of coffee and listen to this selection they're sharing with us.

guest_explanation_headline: Enjoy their morning selection
guest_explanation_track1: Probably hard to believe, but besides us there are some other dope producers representing the Netherlands. Personally we find Henning one of the illest, bringing back that West-Coast G-funk sound. He definitely has the smoothest beats of the country.
guest_explanation_track2: This man has been one of the main inspirations to us since the beginning. People like Freddie Joachim, Dilla and Pete are among the producers we admire the most. Waves is just one of his many classic beats, often characterized by a mellow guitar.
guest_explanation_track3: Man, this song is so dope. We came across Overdoz. like two years ago and Lauren London became our summer anthem for 2012. This song was playing all day while we were chilling to the fullest. Just bump this shit on sunday and enjoy.
